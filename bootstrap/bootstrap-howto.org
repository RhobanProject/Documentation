How to bootstrap a Debian system on a SD card.
Tested on a Debian/amd64 host.

Applies to the Roboard.

!!
  Be warned that it is expected that the SD card is on /dev/sdb.
  If you have two hard drives, it is highly probable that /dev/sdb is your
  second hard drive
!!

* Partition the SD card
 * # parted /dev/sdb
 * Within parted,
   * mkpart (and answer ext3, 64s, 3072M)
   * mkpart (and answer linux-swap, 3072M, 3584M)
   * toggle 1 boot
   * quit

* Prepare/format partitions
 * # mke2fs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1
 * # tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sdb1 
(this is quite important because it will prevent an unexpected fsck at
the wrong moment)
 * # mkswap /dev/sdb2

* Mount root file system
 * # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/roboard

* Bootstrap Debian system (requires installation of debootstrap)
 * # debootstrap --arch=i386 squeeze /mnt/roboard
(lasts quite long)
